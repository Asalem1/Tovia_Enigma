# Tovia_Enigma
Ariel's Coding Challenge for Tovia

This is the completed version of the coding challenge.

It should be noted that isntead of passphrases are sent via the url without the # (so we would be passing the passphrase like so     localhost:3000/abc12).

##GETTING STARTED##
In order to get started, you will need to have MongoDB installed onto your device.

Run an npm install || yarn install to install dependencies.

The package.json contains the necessary commands but here's a TLDR:

- test (takes a snapshot of the components)
- test:update (updates updated components so they don't fail tests)
- lint (lints based on airbnb standards - if you're not using windows feel free to remove the `"linebreak-style": ["error", "windows"]` from `.eslintrc.json)
- watch (to build continuously)
- start (starts the server)
